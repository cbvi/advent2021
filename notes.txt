### Day 2

You can directly read types representing a type from a file with generic packages from Text_IO, eg. Integer_IO, Enumeration_IO.

### Day 3

You can concat the base formatters to strings : `"2#" & Oxygen_String & "#"`

Current implementation isn't great, should read the integers in as integers and operate on them that way instead of parsing the strings.

### Day 4, DAy 5

TODO

### Day 6

Assumed the second part would add more attributes about the fish, so used a record and tracked each individual fish in a vector.
Then part 2 simply increased the amount of time to simulate, which exceeded RAM at day ~160.
